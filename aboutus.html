					In the history of Karnataka, the name of Late Businayana Mukundadas Sreenivasaiah (BMS) occupies a prominent place in

					He started the B.M.S. College of Engineering in the same year. He had forseen the urgent need for high quality 
					technical education in India, even before independence.
